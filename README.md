Spring boot application for tracing consumption of electricity

To be able to successfully start the application, first check the application.properties file and adjust database properties to fit your MySql server/schema. 

After adjustment, run: 'mvn clean install' to build a jar file.
After that is an electricity-tracker jar file built. Go to the target directory and run application like 'java -jar electricity-tracker-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar'.

In the project root directory is Postman Collection to test REST API endpoints. 

Enjoy playing with the application.
